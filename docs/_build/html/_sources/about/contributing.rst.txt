Contributing
=======================================

Contributions are very welcome! We welcome any and all contributions, though they aren't expected. 

Keep in mind this project will benefit most from:

- translations, especially into Chinese Simplified and Chinese Traditional
- attribution (finding sources to original research and useful resources)
- explanation of deeply technical subjects such as `ROP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming>`_, `ACE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution>`_, and hardware specifications

Contribution Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Familiarise yourself with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ and `reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_
- Try to use simple English where possible. Other visitors might not speak English as their first language.

    - Or, use ``.. note:: **Simple English:** your text here`` to provide a Simple English annotation.

- Please respect intellectual property. Don't distribute links to cracked software or internal documents.
- Learn how to use `Git <https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/>`_ so that you can push your changes
- Format your ``.rst`` files nicely. Use a formatter or a linter to *soften the edges* :D

When you're ready, please make a pull request on `GitHub <https://github.com/aidswidjaja/casio/pulls>`_.
